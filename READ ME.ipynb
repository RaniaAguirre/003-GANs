    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic stock data for backtesting an algorithmic trading strategy. The goal is to develop a simple strategy, backtest it using real and generated data, and evaluate its performance using various financial metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into several parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:** Download 10 years of historical stock data for a single stock.We will be using APPLE\n",
    "2. **Model Training:** Use GANs to generate multiple synthetic stock scenarios to enhance backtesting.\n",
    "3. **Strategy Development:** Develop an algorithmic trading strategy (basic version, no hyperparameter optimization yet). We used Bollinger bands.\n",
    "4. **Backtesting:** Backtest the trading strategy using both real data and 100 generated scenarios, testing different stop-loss/take-profit levels.\n",
    "5. **Benchmark Strategy:** Create a passive benchmark strategy for comparison.\n",
    "6. **Performance Metrics:** Measure and present performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio, max drawdown, profit and loss (P&L), and win-loss ratio, assuming a risk-free rate of 0.\n",
    "7. **Visual Results:** Generate and display various plots such as operations, candlestick charts, trading signals, portfolio value over time, etc.\n",
