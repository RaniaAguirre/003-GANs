    "In this chart, we can see the first year of data for the AAPL stock (from November 2014 to November 2015) alongside the generated scenarios. It is worth mentioning that although only one year is shown, the neural network plotted this first year based on the 10 years of historical data downloaded (from November 2014 to November 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe how the simulated scenarios move in the opposite direction to the clear bullish behavior of the stock. This mismatch suggests that the neural network used fails to capture the trends and patterns AAPL went through during these 10 years, indicating that the reliability of the built GAN model is minimal or highly variable depending on the run being executed."

    "We used Bollinger Bands to identify buying opportunities and tried to maximize our Sharpe Ratio by using different Stop Loss and Take Profit levels. For the generated scenarios, our best Sharpe Ratio occurred with a Stop Loss of 1% and a Take Profit of 1%; however, it was negative, and the value of our portfolio decreased by 0.5%.\n",

    "The downward trend in our simulations partly explains why, when identifying sell signals, we ended up hitting the Stop Loss first rather than the Take Profit. This also makes sense given that the TP and SL used were at the 1% level and not higher pairs (our TP and SL ranged from 1% to 11% in equal pairs)."
